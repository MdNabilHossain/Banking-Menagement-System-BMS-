# Banking-Menagement-System-BMS-
mini project in C#
Problem: Write a code for Banking Management System (BMS). There must be three types of account for the BMS: Current account, Credit account & savings account. Every types of account can deposit and withdraw money. The main difference between them is that, there is a credit limit for Credit Account up to which customer can withdraw money even if the account balance is zero. Customer can not withdraw from savings and current account if the balance is zero. Any amount can be deposited in the credit and current account but for saving account there is a fixed amount which can be deposited each time. You should use appropriate and necessary classes, methods, inheritances, constants etc. for this system.
